    <div class="post-title">Invisible networks for the sneaky</div>
    <div class="post-date">Friday, July 19 &#39;13</div>

    <div class="post-wrapper">
      <p>Eyebrows raise. Invisible networks you say &hellip;  If you type</p>

<pre><code> ifconfig
</code></pre>

<p>You&rsquo;ll see all of the network devices currently up: probably eth0 (ethernet) or wlan (wireless), and a lo (loopback) device at least (ifconfig -a for all devices up or down).  Little beknownst to you, these devices exist in a single <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/219794/">network namespace</a>: a place for them all to romp and play happily together.  And by romp and play I mean they can be <a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/BRIDGE-STP-HOWTO/what-is-a-bridge.html">bridged together</a>, they can <a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/IP-Masquerade-HOWTO/ipmasq-background2.1.html">masquerade</a> as one another (I know, it&rsquo;s awesome), or deliberately forward each other packets.</p>

<p>What if I told you that you could steal one of these network devices and put it in a private, invisible network?  You might think, &ldquo;Hmm, that means I can probably run X program on P port in both networks and they won&rsquo;t conflict&rdquo;.  Correct.  Then you might say, &ldquo;Hey!  I could also hide everything I&rsquo;m doing in that invisible network from the rest of my machine&rdquo;.  Yep.  But after a few minutes you&rsquo;d probably say: &ldquo;What! How do I communicate with the outside world?&rdquo;  I&rsquo;d be worried too.</p>

<p>The answer: Virtual ethernet!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait, what?&rdquo;  Virtual ethernet devices are created in pairs, where one &ldquo;veth&rdquo; device can talk directly to its peer, no matter what network you move either of them to.  So if veth0 is in network A and veth1 is in network B, but network B is totally invisible to A, these networks can tunnel messages to one another over their veth secret chat line.  A stranger doesn&rsquo;t know anything about your private network topology other than a veth device exists.  Pretty cool.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ok fine, how do I make an invisible network?&rdquo;  By making another network namespace, by making a pair of veth devices that can talk to each other, and by placing one in the new network namespace and the other in your current namespace.  Command line setup involves:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.dsm.fordham.edu/cgi-bin/man-cgi.pl?topic=ip-netns&amp;ampsect=8">ip netns</a>, for creating, removing, and running commands in network namespaces</li>
<li><a href="http://www.dsm.fordham.edu/cgi-bin/man-cgi.pl?topic=ip-link&amp;sect=&amp;querytype=Man+page&amp;srch=&amp;case=sensitive">ip link</a>, for generally managing network devices</li>
<li><a href="http://www.dsm.fordham.edu/cgi-bin/man-cgi.pl?topic=ip&amp;sect=addr&amp;querytype=Man+page&amp;srch=&amp;case=sensitive">ip addr</a>, for assigning inet and subnet addresses to network devices</li>
<li><a href="http://www.dsm.fordham.edu/cgi-bin/man-cgi.pl?topic=ifconfig&amp;sect=addr&amp;querytype=Man+page&amp;srch=&amp;case=sensitive">ifconfig</a>, for checking the network configuration</li>
<li><a href="http://www.dsm.fordham.edu/cgi-bin/man-cgi.pl?topic=nc&amp;sect=&amp;querytype=Man+page&amp;srch=&amp;case=sensitive">netcat</a>, for testing</li>
</ul>


<p>Warning: some of these commands will fail with mysterious error messages if you&rsquo;re not root.  <code>sudo su</code> to save yourself the confusion.</p>

<p>In Terminal 1:</p>

<pre><code>#!sh
# name a new network namespace
# this is not the network namespace you're in right now
# but we can enter it by name now at any time
ip netns add ns1

# check that the new network namespace is present
ip netns list

# create a pair of veth devices
ip link add host type veth peer name guest

# make sure you can see both host and guest (down)
ifconfig -a

# bring the host veth device up, it will exist in the current
# network namespace
ip link set host up

# give up the guest veth device to the new network
ip link set guest netns ns1

# assign an ip and subnet to the host veth
ip addr add 192.168.0.101/24 dev host

# check that the address shows up
ifconfig
</code></pre>

<p>In Terminal 2:</p>

<pre><code>#!sh
# execute a bash shell in your newly named network
ip netns exec ns1 bash

# check that you can see the guest veth device (down)
ifconfig -a

# bring the guest veth device up
# assign an ip and subnet to it
ip link set GUEST up
ip addr add 192.168.0.102/24

# check that the guest veth device is up with an address
ifconfig
</code></pre>

<p>Drumroooool &hellip;. In Terminal 2:</p>

<pre><code>#!sh
# check that you can ping the host veth device
# in the guest's network
ping 192.168.0.101
</code></pre>

<p>In Terminal 1:</p>

<pre><code>#!sh
# set up a netcat listening server
nc -l 192.168.0.101 5555
</code></pre>

<p>In Terminal 2:</p>

<pre><code>#!sh
# set up a netcat client
nc 192.168.0.101 5555

# say hi to the host veth device!
hi
</code></pre>

<p>You should see hi in Terminal 1. Mission accomplished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ugh, how do I tear this down?&rdquo; In Terminal 1:</p>

<pre><code>ip link delete host
</code></pre>

<p>If you check Terminal 2, you&rsquo;ll see that guest cannot live without it&rsquo;s buddy, and has already committed suicide.</p>

<p>To come:</p>

<ul>
<li>Attaching a veth device to the internet at large</li>
<li>Doing this all in a compiled language, for better portability</li>
</ul>
